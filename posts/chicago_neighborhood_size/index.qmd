## Premise

In certain methods of [spatial cross-validation](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-cv.html#intro-cv), you need to set an inclusion radius and a buffer distance for the folds into which you divide your data. I am working with census tracts, and think it would make sense to use distances based on neighborhoods to set the inclusion radius and buffer distance.

## Set-Up

Load the data wrangling and mapping libraries, then import Chicago neighborhoods:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| error: false
#| cache: true

library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)

# Source: Chicago Data Portal - Boundaries - Neighborhoods
# URL: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Neighborhoods/bbvz-uum9
neighborhoods <- st_read(here::here("data", "boundaries_neighborhoods_chicago.kml"))
```

## Calculations

1. Use [S2 backend](https://s2geometry.io/) of [sf library](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html) to calculate areas of each neighborhood
2. Calculate a rough radius of each neighborhood by treating it as if it were a circle
3. Calcuate the average rough radius

```{r}
#| cache: true
neighborhoods |> 
    mutate(
        area = st_area(neighborhoods),
        rough_radius = sqrt(area/pi)
    ) |> 
    summarize(avg_rough_radius = mean(rough_radius))
```
The average rough radius is about 1273 meters.

## Visualize

Visualize what it looks like to add a 1300 meter buffer zone around each neighborhood:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| error: false
#| message: false
#| cache: true

buffers <- st_buffer(neighborhoods, 1300)
```
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| error: false
#| message: false

tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(buffers) + tm_polygons(col = "pri_neigh", alpha = 0.5, border.alpha = 0) + tm_shape(neighborhoods) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0)
```
